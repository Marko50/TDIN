In this example we can see the differences relative to the
activation mode of the remote class.

You can find 3 different configuration files:
Client.exe.singleton
Client.exe.singlecall
Client.exe.activated

To put the client working in one of the corresponding
activation modes copy one of the above files to
Client.exe.config.

In the server you should do the same (using the same
activation mode) overwriting the file Server.exe.config.
